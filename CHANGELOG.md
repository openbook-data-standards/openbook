## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0-draft] — 2026-09-12

Not frozen; the wire may change before 1.0.

### Added
- `docs/decisions.md` — the design decision log (Q1–Q9 decided; Q7 proposed;
  Q10–Q13 open): purpose, matching via standard facts, provenance, shared vs
  publisher-own ids, slug + URN id spelling, external ids, diffs everywhere
  with JSON Merge Patch semantics, sequence-based `since`, ISO 8601 everywhere.
- `docs/building-blocks.md` — the widely used standards OpenBook builds on
  (ISO 3166-1/-2, 639-1, 4217, 8601/RFC 3339, Wikidata, schema.org, RFC 7386,
  RFC 8141, UUID v7, JSON Schema, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, CloudEvents, RFC 9457).
- `docs/industry-patterns.md` — review of public betting APIs (KIBL, Pinnacle,
  Betfair, Sportradar, GTFS-Realtime): patterns adopted and avoided.

- `docs/industry-patterns.md`: OpenStreetMap (tag governance, id+version,
  OsmChange minutely diffs, Wikidata cross-refs) and the weather system (WMO
  WIS 2.0 MQTT pub/sub and topic hierarchy, OASIS CAP 1.2 alerts, METAR/TAF,
  GRIB/BUFR, NWS API). Decisions Q14 (stream grammar) and Q15 (alerts) opened.

### Changed (the v0.2 spec rewrite)
- Fixtures, leagues, teams and players are **publisher-own ids + standard
  facts** (Q2/Q4/Q7); the v0.1 neutral minted fixture id is gone.
- `source` + `provenance` on every market (Q1/Q3); `sequence` + `updated_at`
  on every object; `fixture_change` and `market_status` messages; `since=` as
  a sequence cursor; JSON Merge Patch semantics for all changes (Q8).
- Wikidata QID as the shared entity id on leagues, participants, players,
  venues, territories — required when it exists, null otherwise (Q12).
- New schemas: `common`, `publisher`, `reference_region`,
  `reference_participant`, `fixture_change`, `market_status`; `fixture` and
  `odds_change` rewritten. New examples for `fixture_change`, `market_status`.
- Proposed and implemented provisionally: stream grammar (Q14), CAP-shaped
  market_status (Q15).
- Region model per Q10: CLDR territories (ISO 3166-1/-2 + `XK`/`EU`/`UN`) with
  CLDR localized names; `ioc_code` / `fifa_code` / `wikidata` crosswalks.

## [0.1.0-draft] — 2026-09-12

Initial scaffold. Not frozen; the wire may change before 1.0.

### Added
- The two-tier model (reference + live) and core conventions
  (readable namespaced ids, ISO 8601 / 4217 / 3166, decimal odds).
- Reference objects: sport, region/location, league, season, participant,
  player, segment, market type, side, fixture.
- Live messages: `odds_change`, `score_change`, `settlement`, `market_status`.
- JSON Schemas for `reference_sport`, `fixture`, `market_type`, `odds_change`.
- Controlled vocabularies (starter): sports (with athletics disciplines),
  market types.
- Governance model (open spec / closed code, staged governance), versioning
  rules, contributing guide, and validating examples.
