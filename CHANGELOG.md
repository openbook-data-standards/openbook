# Changelog

All notable changes to the OpenBook standard are recorded here.
Format follows Keep a Changelog; versioning follows [`VERSIONING.md`](VERSIONING.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `docs/decisions.md` — the design decision log (Q1–Q9 decided; Q7 proposed;
  Q10–Q13 open): purpose, matching via standard facts, provenance, shared vs
  publisher-own ids, slug + URN id spelling, external ids, diffs everywhere
  with JSON Merge Patch semantics, sequence-based `since`, ISO 8601 everywhere.
- `docs/building-blocks.md` — the widely used standards OpenBook builds on
  (ISO 3166-1/-2, 639-1, 4217, 8601/RFC 3339, Wikidata, schema.org, RFC 7386,
  RFC 8141, UUID v7, JSON Schema, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, CloudEvents, RFC 9457).
- `docs/industry-patterns.md` — review of public betting APIs (KIBL, Pinnacle,
  Betfair, Sportradar, GTFS-Realtime): patterns adopted and avoided.

### Pending spec changes (v0.2)
- Fixtures, leagues, teams and players become **publisher-own ids + standard
  facts** (Q2/Q4); the v0.1 text still describes a neutral minted fixture id.
- Add `source` and `provenance` to every price (Q1/Q3); `sequence` and
  `updated_at` to every object; `fixture_change` message; `since=` on pull
  endpoints; JSON Merge Patch semantics for all change messages (Q8).
- Region model per Q10: CLDR territories (ISO 3166-1/-2 + `XK`/`EU`/`UN`) with
  CLDR localized names; `ioc_code` / `fifa_code` / `wikidata` crosswalks.

## [0.1.0-draft] — 2026-09-12

Initial scaffold. Not frozen; the wire may change before 1.0.

### Added
- The two-tier model (reference + live) and core conventions
  (readable namespaced ids, ISO 8601 / 4217 / 3166, decimal odds).
- Reference objects: sport, region/location, league, season, participant,
  player, segment, market type, side, fixture.
- Live messages: `odds_change`, `score_change`, `settlement`, `market_status`.
- JSON Schemas for `reference_sport`, `fixture`, `market_type`, `odds_change`.
- Controlled vocabularies (starter): sports (with athletics disciplines),
  market types.
- Governance model (open spec / closed code, staged governance), versioning
  rules, contributing guide, and validating examples.
